# hello-world
This is my repository to organize my attempt to learn to code.
I am a disabled combat veteran and medically retired deputy sheriff. Not long ago I took advantage of the VA vocational rehab program and earned some certs, my highest being Certified Ethical Hacker. I have a passion for cyber security.
Unfortunately, the jobs for cyber security in my area are few and far between. With that in mind I decided to try and learn to code. I feel that it will not only help me branch out in my computer science career, but it will help me as a hacker.
